## Checkpoint 3

The problem is called fizz buzz, and has been used in job interviews, university entrance tests, and more for as long as I can remember. Your goal is to loop from 1 through 100, and for each number:

1. If it’s a multiple of 3, print “Fizz”
2. If it’s a multiple of 5, print “Buzz”
3. If it’s a multiple of 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz”
4. Otherwise, just print the number.

So, here are some example values you should have when your code runs:

* 1 should print “1”
* 2 should print “2”
* 3 should print “Fizz”
* 4 should print “4”
* 5 should print “Buzz”
* 6 should print “Fizz”
* 7 should print “7”
* …
* 15 should print “FizzBuzz”
* …
* 100 should print “Buzz”
