## Checkpoint 5

You’ve already met sorted(), filter(), map(), so I’d like you to put them together in a chain – call one, then the other, then the other back to back without using temporary variables.

Your input is this:

```swift
let luckyNumbers = [7, 4, 38, 21, 16, 15, 12, 33, 31, 49]
```

Your job is to:

1. Filter out any numbers that are even
2. Sort the array in ascending order
3. Map them to strings in the format “7 is a lucky number”
4. Print the resulting array, one item per line

So, your output should be as follows:

```
7 is a lucky number
15 is a lucky number
21 is a lucky number
31 is a lucky number
33 is a lucky number
49 is a lucky number
```
