# Functions, part 2

## Checkpoint 4

The challenge is this: write a function that accepts an integer from 1 through 10,000, and returns the integer square root of that number. That sounds easy, but there are some catches:

1. You can’t use Swift’s built-in sqrt() function or similar – you need to find the square root yourself.
2. If the number is less than 1 or greater than 10,000 you should throw an “out of bounds” error.
3. You should only consider integer square roots – don’t worry about the square root of 3 being 1.732, for example.
4. If you can’t find the square root, throw a “no root” error.
